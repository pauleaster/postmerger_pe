# Postmerger PE code

To make this work you need to use Bilby version 0.5.6

`pip install bilby==0.5.6`

You also need to download the numerical-relativity simulation files that you want from:

`https://core-gitlfs.tpi.uni-jena.de/core_database/`

For instance, the code listed here used the SLy THC:0036:R03 simulation listed here:

`https://core-gitlfs.tpi.uni-jena.de/core_database/THC_0036/-/tree/master/R03`

and place the `THC:0036:R03.tar` file in the `./NRtars` directory.
